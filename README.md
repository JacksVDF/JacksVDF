<h2 align="center">Hello there!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Julian A. Cardona</h2>
<h4 align="center">I'm a Software Craftsman, Web Developer and 2D Artist</h4>

<p align="center">
  Despite being quite new to the computing field, I'm interested in the technological development of the world. I'm curious about artificial intelligence issues and in the future I would like to go deeper into cybersecurity.

<h1 align="center">My knowledge</h1>

<p align="center">
    <b> Programming Languages</b>
  <br/>
    These are my main languages. I use them quite often for problem solving in websites like HackerRank, CodeWars and CodeChef.

    <b> Dev Setup</b>
  <br/>
  I'm a big fan of terminal development, especially if it's bash. I like working from Linux environments (I use Arch btw) but WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is slowly winning my heart and even though I'm new to Git I feel comfortable with it. My favorite code editor is Visual Studio Code because of how intuitive and friendly it is, not to mention that it has extensions for just about everything.

<h1 align="center">Dev Stacks</h1>

<p align="center">
  I've been learning the MERN Stack for a while now and I've found it great for web development. I would like to complement this stack with Angular in the future.

<p align="center">
  These are my additional knowledge which I have not known where to put them but which seem important to me just the same.
